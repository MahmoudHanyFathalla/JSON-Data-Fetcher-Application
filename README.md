# JSON-Data-Fetcher-Application
This project is a C++ application built using the Qt framework. It fetches JSON data from a public API (JSONPlaceholder) using libcurl, parses the data using the nlohmann/json library, and displays it in a user-friendly table format within a Qt-based GUI. The application is designed to be cross-platform and supports both Qt5 and Qt6.
